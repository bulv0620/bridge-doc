## Sharing Settings

Click the settings button in the top-right corner to open the dialog. Enable **LAN Discovery** and confirm to start the sharing service.

After enabling LAN Discovery, other devices on the same network will be able to detect this device. You can then enable the following sharing features as needed:

- **File Receiving**: Allow receiving files pushed from other devices.
- **Clipboard Sharing**: Automatically sync clipboard across devices.



## File Sending

Click or drag files into the dashed box to upload local files. After uploading, you will see a list of available target devices on the right. Click the desired device to send the uploaded file.

> Note: The target device must have **File Receiving** enabled in its settings.

The sending process includes the following steps:

1. The sender initiates a confirmation request.
2. The receiver confirms the request.
3. The file is transferred (sent/received).

Files that are **Sending**, **Sent**, **Receiving**, or **Received** will be displayed in the list below.



## Shared Clipboard

All devices on the same LAN with Clipboard Sharing enabled will share their clipboards. For example, if you copy content on Device A, you can directly paste it on Device B.

Open the Shared Clipboard panel to view clipboard history, where you can copy items again if needed.

> The Shared Clipboard feature currently supports sharing text and images only.
